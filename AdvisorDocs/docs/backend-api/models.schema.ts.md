# `models.schema.ts`

The `models.schema.ts` file defines JSON schemas for model serialization in a Fastify application. These schemas are designed to ensure data integrity and consistency when data is transferred between server and client. This file specifically deals with model data related to a hypothetical database, focusing on categories and their associated products.

## Overview

The schema defined in this file represents categories from a database, providing a structure for serialization that includes various fields such as `id`, `name`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `products`. Each field is strictly typed to ensure that the data conforms to expected formats.

## Schema Details

### `categorySchema`

This schema represents a category object. It includes several fields:

- **id** (`string`): Unique identifier for the category.
- **name** (`string`): Name of the category.
- **createdAt** (`string`): ISO8601 date string representing when the category was created.
- **updatedAt** (`string` or `null`): ISO8601 date string or null value representing when the category was last updated.
- **products** (`array`): An array of products associated with the category, referenced by another schema (`productSchema`).

#### Schema Configuration:

```json
{
  "$id": "categorySchema",
  "type": "object",
  "nullable": true,
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "createdAt": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    },
    "updatedAt": {
      "type": ["string", "null"],
      "format": "date-time"
    },
    "products": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "$ref": "productSchema#"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

In a Fastify application, this schema can be used to validate responses from API endpoints that deal with categories, ensuring that the data sent to clients adheres to the defined structure. This is particularly useful in CRUD operations where consistency across operations (like Create, Read, Update, Delete) is critical.

### Integration with Fastify

To integrate these schemas into a Fastify app, you would typically add them to your Fastify instance using the `addSchema` method. This method allows you to reference these schemas across your application wherever needed.

```javascript
fastify.addSchema(categorySchema);
```

### References

The schema references `productSchema`, which needs to be defined in your application. This modular approach allows for schemas to be reused and combined, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Conclusion

The `models.schema.ts` file plays a crucial role in defining data structures for database models in a Fastify application, ensuring that data conforms to specified formats and structures. This ensures robust data handling and validation across the application, making the API more reliable and easier to maintain.
