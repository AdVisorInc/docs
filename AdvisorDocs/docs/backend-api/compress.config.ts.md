# `compress.config.ts`

`compress.config.ts` is a configuration file for the `fastify-compress` plugin used within a Fastify application. This plugin is essential for setting up compression of HTTP responses, which can help to improve the performance of the server by reducing the size of the data transferred over the network.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Configure response compression for a Fastify server.
- **Primary Function**: Provides settings to enable and manage compression of HTTP responses.
- **Documentation Reference**: [Fastify Compress](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-compress#compress-options)

## Configuration Details

Here are the key configurations specified in `compress.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default {
  global: true,
  threshold: 1024,
};
```

### Parameters

- **`global`**: This parameter is a boolean that indicates whether the compression should be applied globally to all responses from the server. When set to `true`, it activates compression for all routes.

- **`threshold`**: This is a numeric value that specifies the minimum response size in bytes before compression is applied. In this configuration, responses below 1024 bytes will not be compressed. This is useful for avoiding the overhead of compressing very small response payloads.

### Usage

To utilize this configuration, it must be registered with the Fastify instance during server setup, typically in an initial configuration or setup file like `app.ts`.

### Additional Notes

- **Performance Consideration**: While the `fastify-compress` plugin can handle compression internally, for large-scale applications or high-load environments, offloading compression to a reverse proxy like Nginx might be more efficient. This can free up server resources and leverage optimizations available in such proxies.

## Example of Integration in Fastify

Hereâ€™s a simple example snippet on how you might integrate this configuration in the Fastify app setup:

```typescript
import fastify from "fastify";
import compressConfig from "./config/compress.config";

const app = fastify();

// Register compression with the provided configurations
app.register(require("fastify-compress"), compressConfig);

app.listen(3000, (err) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

## Conclusion

The `compress.config.ts` file is a concise but crucial part of configuring response compression in a Fastify application, helping to enhance performance by reducing the size of the data being transmitted. Proper configuration and consideration of when to use internal vs. external compression are key to maximizing the effectiveness of this feature.
