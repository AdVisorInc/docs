# `cors.config.ts`

## Overview

The `cors.config.ts` file configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a web application server using Fastify. CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This configuration is crucial for enabling or restricting web resources in a cross-domain environment.

This file utilizes the Fastify CORS plugin configuration options as documented [here](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cors#options).

## Configuration Details

### Code Snippet

```typescript
// See: https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cors#options
export default {
  origin: "*",
};
```

### Properties

- **origin:** Defines the allowed origin for cross-domain requests. Here, it is set to `' * '`, which means that the server will accept requests from any origin. While this setting is suitable for development or open public APIs, it's generally recommended to restrict origins in production environments to enhance security.

## Considerations

- **Security Risks:** Using a wildcard (`*`) for the `origin` in production is risky as it allows any website to make requests to your API or web application. It is advisable to specify explicit domains in production.
- **Usage in Production:** For production environments, list specific domains or use a function to dynamically validate origins against a list of allowed domains.
- **Dependencies:** This configuration assumes that the `@fastify/cors` plugin is correctly installed and integrated within the Fastify application.

## Example of Restricting Origins in Production

Here's an example of how you might configure `cors.config.ts` to handle specific domains in a production environment:

```typescript
export default {
  origin: ["https://example.com", "https://api.example.com"],
};
```

This setup ensures that only requests from `https://example.com` and `https://api.example.com` are allowed, enhancing the security posture of your application.

## Conclusion

The `cors.config.ts` file provides a simple yet powerful configuration for handling CORS in a Fastify application. Properly configuring CORS is essential for both the functionality and security of web applications that interact with resources from different origins.
