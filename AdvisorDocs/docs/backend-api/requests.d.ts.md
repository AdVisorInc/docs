# `requests.d.ts`

The `requests.d.ts` file in a TypeScript project is typically used to declare custom types or interfaces that relate to request objects in an application. This file is part of the typings that help developers ensure that they are handling request data correctly throughout the application. Below is a detailed explanation of the types defined within this file and their intended use cases.

## Types Defined

### `CrudAllRequest`

This type is used to define the expected structure of a request object when dealing with operations that affect multiple resources (e.g., fetching a list of resources).

**Properties:**

- **`Querystring`**: This property specifies the expected query parameters.
  - `take`: A `number` specifying the number of items to retrieve.
  - `from?`: An optional `string` that may be used to indicate a starting point or offset for the fetch operation.

**Usage Example:**

When implementing an API endpoint to fetch a list of items, `CrudAllRequest` can be used to ensure that the request query parameters adhere to the expected format.

```typescript
import { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";

interface CrudAllRequest {
  Querystring: {
    take: number;
    from?: string;
  };
}

const listHandler = async (request: FastifyRequest<CrudAllRequest>) => {
  const { take, from } = request.query;
  // Implementation here
};
```

### `CrudIdRequest`

This type is specifically designed for operations involving a single resource identified by an ID.

**Properties:**

- **`Params`**: This property outlines the structure for path parameters used in the request.
  - `id`: A `string` that represents the unique identifier of the resource.

**Usage Example:**

This type is useful when you create an API endpoint that operates on a specific resource identified by an ID, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting a resource.

```typescript
import { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";

interface CrudIdRequest {
  Params: {
    id: string;
  };
}

const getResourceHandler = async (request: FastifyRequest<CrudIdRequest>) => {
  const { id } = request.params;
  // Fetch and return the resource with the given ID
};
```

## Conclusion

The `requests.d.ts` file simplifies the management of request data structures across the application, promoting type safety and reducing errors during development. By defining and using these types, you can ensure that your application handlers are receiving and processing the expected data from client requests.

This type of setup is crucial for maintaining robustness and scalability in web applications, especially those built with TypeScript on frameworks like Fastify or Express.js.
