# `helmet.config.ts`

`helmet.config.ts` is a configuration file that specifies settings for using the [`fastify-helmet`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet) plugin with a Fastify server application. The `fastify-helmet` plugin is crucial for securing Fastify applications by setting various HTTP headers.

## Content of `helmet.config.ts`

```typescript
// See https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet#how-it-works
export default {
  global: true,
};
```

## Configuration Details

- `global`: This key is set to `true`, indicating that helmet's security headers should be applied globally to all routes in the Fastify application. This is a simple and effective way to ensure that all responses from the server include the necessary security headers, without having to manually apply the security policies to individual routes.

## Usage

This configuration object is typically imported and used in the main server file where Fastify plugins are registered. Here is an example of how it might be used:

```typescript
import fastify from "fastify";
import helmetConfig from "./config/helmet.config";
import fastifyHelmet from "@fastify/helmet";

const app = fastify();

// Register Helmet with global configuration
app.register(fastifyHelmet, helmetConfig);

app.listen(3000, (err) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  console.log("Server listening on 3000");
});
```

This configuration is essential for enhancing the security posture of your Fastify application by leveraging the well-established practices encapsulated in the Helmet library.
